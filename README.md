# WoW AntiAFK
 
## How it works
The tools opens the WoW window and moves your character randomly in random interval that is specified in the GUI. You can also choose to then switch to other window and keep WoW in the backgroud.

***WIndows marks the software as a virus, since it controls your PC. You need to make an exception for it.***
