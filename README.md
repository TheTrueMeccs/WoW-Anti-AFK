# WoW AntiAFK
 
## How it works
The tools opens the WoW window and moves your character randomly in random interval that is specified in the GUI.

***Windows marks the software as a virus, since it controls your PC. You need to make an exception for it.***

## Changelog
### 0.3.0
- Added a option to hit ENTER in case the character logged out into the character select screen
- Added a timer to indicate when the next movement will occur
